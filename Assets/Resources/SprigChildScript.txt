P:Hey did you see a bird just now?!
R:A bird? There are lots of birds in the forest.
P:No, I mean a singing bird! I have to find it again to hear that song it was singing.
R:Hmmm, well... that's nice, but I'm training right now.
P:Training? Really? What for?
R:I'm the Junior Village Caretaker. I'm learning how to take care of the village.
P:What is that, like a boy scout or something?
R:What, no! It's my assigned purpose. It's a big deal. What about you?
P:Uhh.. uhh.. I'm going to be a dragon!
R:We're not playing pretend!
P:Dragons aren't pretend!
R:Whatever, weird dragon-kid. If you're still looking for that bird, you should go talk to Egbert.
R:He knows all sorts of stuff about birds. Though if you ask me, you probably have more important things to worry about.
