P:Ahh! (It moved!)
R:Ahhh!
P:(It spoke!) What the heck are you?!
R:How rude! I'm the Junior Village Caretaker in training!
P:Uh, what is that, like a boy scout or something?
R:What, no! 
R:When I grow up, I am going to take care of the village, the forest, and everyone who lives here.
R:It's my purpose in the village. Haven't you had yours assigned to you?
P:Uh, I don't know. Should I have?
R:Well, I would think so.
R:Maybe go ask my neighbor Egbert for your purpose. He's an adult, he knows about that kind of thing.
R:If you ask me, there's nothing more important than finding your purpose.
