R:Well, well, if it isn’t the dragon-kid. Or should I call you Mr. Dragon now? 
P:Uh, hey Sprig. Please don’t call me Mr. Dragon. So, uhh are you still in training? 
R:Yes! I learn so much from Giovanni every day. Yesterday I learned about taking care of mushrooms in the forest!
P:That sounds nice (it really does...).
R:So… what’s it like? I mean being a grown up now?
P:Uhh… Well, it’s fine, I guess. 
R:No, I mean, what’s it like having a house? And a family and a job and stuff?
P:Well… I don’t really have all of those things just yet.
R:What do you mean? You’re old now. You must have some of those things?
P:For one, I’m only 30. For two, I have a job and an apartment. No house, no wife or kids (not even a girlfriend at the moment, thanks for the reminder). 
R:That’s weird isn’t it? That’s stuff grown-ups are supposed to do.
P:Well kid, things don’t always work out the way you think they will. I’m doing what I need to do to get by, and that’s all I can really do right now.
R:Still seems weird.
P:Well.. that's how it is. It was nice seeing you, Sprig. Best of luck with your training.
