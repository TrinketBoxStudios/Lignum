P:(It's been years since I've been here, but everything feels exactly the same...)
R:Oh! It's you! It's been a long time.
P:Uh, hey Sprig. Yeah, it's been a while. Are you still in training?
R:Yes! I learn so much from Giovanni every day. Yesterday I learned about taking care of mushrooms in the forest.
P:That sounds nice, (it really does...).
R:So... what's it like? I mean, being a grown-up now?
P:Uhh... Well, it's fine, I guess.
R:No, I mean, what's it like having a house? And a family and a job and stuff?
P:Well... I don't really have all of those things just yet.
R:What do you mean? You're old now. You must have some of those things.
P:For one, I'm 28. For two, I have a job and an apartment. No house, no wife or kids.
R:That's weird, isn't it? That's stuff grown-ups are supposed to do.
P:(Well, it's nice to see Sprig hasn't changed much.) Things don't always work out the way you think they will. 
P:I'm doing what I need to do to get by, that's all.
R:Oh, okay.
P:(Stop judging me, kid!) Well... that's how it is. It was nice seeing you, Sprig. Best of luck with your training.
