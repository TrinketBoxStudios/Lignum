R:My, my! I've been waiting a long time for you.
P:Ha ha! And I've been waiting a long time for this day.
R:You've come so far from when I first met you as a sprout. 
R:You've accumulated a lifetime's worth of experiences and memories. You've sought out much and you've lost much.
R:Tell me, was it worth is?
P:... I don't know if it was worth it.
R:Oh?
P:Yes. I don't know if it was worth it. 
P:I don't know what would have happened if I'd never made a leap of faith, or if I'd done things just a little bit differently.
P:I don't know how my life measures up in comparison or in balance. But the reason where I'm here today...
P:...is because I'm okay with not knowing.
R:Ha ha! Then at last, you understand. 
R:I don't have any wisdom left to share with you. Open the door once more... You are almost at the end of your journey.
