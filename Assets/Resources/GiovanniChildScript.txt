R:Well, hello there. Is there something I can help you with, sprout?
P:Well... I don't know why I'm here, and Sprig made fun of me for not knowing my purpose, and Egbert isn't an inventor like he wanted...
R:Whoa, slow down there! These old ears can only take in so much.
R:What it sounds like to me is that you are searching for something?
P:Really? Like what?
R:Well, sprout, I think you're actually searching for your purpose.
P:Don't I get one assigned to me, like Sprig and Egbert?
R:Ha ha! Sorry sprout, humans don't get assigned one like we do. You'll have to figure it out on your own.
P:No, please tell me what I should do! You're old, you should know the answers!
R:The answer, sprout, is that you are embarking on a journey that every sentient being must go through.
P:A journey? Like a quest?? Do I have to slay a dragon or save a princess??
R:Maybe, maybe not. Only the trees may know for sure. You'll have to discover for yourself what's in store.
P:So what do I do now? Oh, oh, do I get a sword and shield?
R:There is an old door farther up this tree. After you enter, it's up to you.
