R:Well, hello there. I noticed you enjoying my little songbird. Quite the performer, ain't she?
P:Yes, but not the bird I'm looking for...
R:Is something troubling you, sprout?
P:Well... I started looking for this bird, but I can't find it. And then I wanted to be a dragon, but Sprig made fun of me, and Egbert isn't an inventor like he wanted...
R:Whoa, slow down there! These old ears can only take in so much.
R:What it sounds like to me is that you are searching for something. 
P:Yes, a bird.
R:No, no, much more than that! You are embarking on a quest that every sentient being must go through.
P:A quest?? Do I have to slay a dragon or save a princess??
R:Maybe, maybe not. Only the trees may know for sure. You will have to discover for yourself what's in store.
P:Wow, this all sounds so cool! So does that mean I get to go on an adventure??
R:[chuckle] Yes, yes, sprout. Something like that.
P:So what do I do now? Oh, oh, do I get a sword and shield?
R:There is an old door farther up this tree. After you enter, you will find all that you need there.
