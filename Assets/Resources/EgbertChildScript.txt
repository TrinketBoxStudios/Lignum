P:Oh! A bird!
R:Woah there, what's all the excitement about?
P:Oh sorry, sir. I just saw the bird and got excited.
R:(Hey, c'mon, don't call me "sir"...) Well, what can I help you with?
P:Oh, well actually... I was wondering, do you have a purpose here, too?
R:Here in the village? Well, of course. Everyone who lives here is given an assigned purpose. 
R:It's quite a celebration when it's discovered in our young sprouts.
P:Discovered?
R:Well, sure. We keep a close eye on our sprouts until they show a skill that can benefit the village. 
R:Then they are trained in what they are best in.
P:Like that leafy guy becoming the Village Caretaker?
R:Oh, you mean Sprig? Yup, just like that. He's quite the talented little guy. He was hand-chosen by Ol' Giovanni himself.
P:Hmm... Well then, how do I find out what I'm good at?
R:Ahh, you remind me of me when I was a kid. I wanted to be an inventor back then.
P:Really?! That's so cool. What have you invented?
R:Actually... I became a ranger. I had some great skills in identifying wildlife, and it benefitted the village more.
P:Oh.
R:Err, well, if you have any other questions, you could ask Giovanni himself. He's the one who decides everyone's purpose.
R:He's a little bit farther up the tree.
