P:(Here I am, once again. Everything looks familiar and different at the same time. Is it the forest that's changed, or is it me?)
P:Hello there, Sprig.
R:Oh! It's nice to see you. Listen, I finally finished my training! I'm officially the Junior Village Caretaker.
P:Ha ha! I'm so glad for you, Sprig. Congratulations!
R:What about you? Did you find your purpose?
P:(Heh, same old Sprig. Youth never changes.)
P:Well Sprig, how about I tell you about my life, and you tell me what you think?
R:Hm. Yes, I can do that.
P:Well, since I last saw you, I quit my job that I hated. I tried starting my own business - a small independent bakery.
R:Wow! That all sounds pretty great.
P:Well, ten years after I started out, I just couldn't keep the shop afloat. 
P:I had to close it, sell everything I owned, and move back in with my parents.
R:Oh...
P:I ended up going back to a 9-5 desk job. But you know, it was different that time around. 
P:My boss was nicer and my co-workers were friendly.
P:But the most important thing was that I had a new perspective. I knew that I'd tried, which was more than most people ever have.
R:But you still ended up right back where you started.
P:Not quite, Sprig! I never stopped trying. 
P:I never quit my job, either, but I started pursuing more goals and trying to better myself when I could.
P:I learned how to play the violin. I bought a fixer-upper. I traveled as much as I could. And I learned to love...
R:Oh! So you did meet someone and fall in love and have kids?
P: Ha ha! Sprig, it was even more important than that. I learned to love who I was.
R:... I guess I just don't get it at all.
P:That's alright, Sprig. You can ask Giovanni for the answer someday.
