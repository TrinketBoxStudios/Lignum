P:Hi, Egbert.
R:Whoa, hey there! There's a face I haven't seen in a while. How's life been, man?
P: Can't complain too much. Surviving, ya know?
R:Glad to hear things are alright. And I mean as long as you're happy, that's what really matters.
P:You know, it doesn't really seem like most people feel that way. I'd say that basic survival is the most important thing for me right now.
R:Oh, well... really? I mean, I try to keep things simple and I do what I like for the most part and that gets me by.
P:Sure, but don't you have any kind of responsibilities? Like paying bills or building a career?
R:Well, of course I do! Who doesn't? I have all kinds of things I have to worry about being a ranger and all. My job is fine. Ferd and I live comfortable lives.
R:But, I just... I always think about things that I want to make. I always wonder what life would be like if I had found a way to invent things.
P:We can't think like that, man. We have to just make it through day by day, ya know?
R:Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just hard to swallow sometimes.
P:We'll just keep on keeping on, right?
R:Right.
