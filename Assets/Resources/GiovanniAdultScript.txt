R:Why hello there, sprout. You look like you've gotten older and wiser.
P:Older, yeah. But, I don't know about wiser.
R:Why do you say that?
P:I hate to say it, but talking to Sprig and Egbert made me realize I haven't done anything with my life.
R:Sprout, do you remember what I told you the last time you came around?
P:Not... not really. I think we were talking about having to find my own purpose. Which I also haven't come remotely close to doing.
R:If you can't find your purpose in life, why not find happiness instead?
P:Happiness? I'm even further from that than purpose.
P:Life's been one headache after another. One disappointment after the next.
R:You may feel like you've wasted your time so far. If that's the case, then you've been looking at it all wrong. 
R:You have the rest of your life ahead of you!
R:Open your eyes and most of all, don't be afraid! Take risks! Move! 
R:The worst thing you could do is to stay exactly where you are, unhappy and unfulfilled.
R:You may not know what direction you're heading in. 
R:The important thing is that you'll never find either purpose or happiness staying in exactly the same place.
P:... I think you're right.
R:What will you do?
P:Anything. Anything at all.
R:In that case, go through the door. I'll be waiting for you once you've found what you're looking for.
