P:Egbert? Hello?
R:Whoa, hey there! There’s a face I haven’t seen in a while. How’s life been, man?
P:Can’t complain too much, surviving, ya know?
R:Glad to hear things are alright. And I mean as long as you are happy, that’s what really matters.
P:You know, it doesn’t really seem like most people feel that way. I’d say that survival and getting by is more important for me right now.
R:Oh, well… really? I mean, I try to keep things simple and I do what I like for the most part and that gets me by.
P:Sure, but don’t you have any kind of responsibilities? Like paying bills or building a career?
R:Well, of course I do! Who doesn’t? I have all kinds of things I have to worry about being a ranger and all. My job is fine and Ferd and I live comfortable lives. But, I just… I always think about things that I want to make. I always wonder what life would be like if I had found a way to invent things.
P:I hear ya, man, but we gotta take care of #1. 
P:We have to just make it through day by day, right?
R:Is it really taking care of #1 if you are unhappy?
R:No. You know what no. I don't have to do this. What am I really doing as a ranger anyway? Well, I mean I know it's important for the village, but someone else can do this. This shouldn't have to be just my burden.
